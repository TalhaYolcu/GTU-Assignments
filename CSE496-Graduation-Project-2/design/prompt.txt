I have project that, firstly has a splash screen. Don't worry about visual interface, I'll handle it
I want you to show a splash screen to the user when user starts the app, I'll provide necesarry asset file, don't worry about it
App will be written in Flutter-Dart. After splash screen, if user is has login before and selected remember me on that login screen, then show the main screen.
If user has not login before, show signup screen. In signup screen, email, Name, surname, nickname, password, password confirm inputs should be taken.
There should be a text about : "Already have an account, Sign in", if user presses sign in text, user should forwarded to signin screen
There should be also sign up with Google option.
In sign in screen, nickname and password inputs should be taken. There should be a text about : "Don't have an account? Sign Up". If user presses Sign Up text, user should be forwarded to signup screen
There should be also sign in with Google option
There should be a remember me option and it should work properly as I mentioned
And the language of the application should use the systems- phones language.
