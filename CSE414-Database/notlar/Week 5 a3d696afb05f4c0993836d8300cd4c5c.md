# Week 5

## What are Views?

- Some cases, it is not desirable for all users to see the entire logical model.
- Consider a person who needs to know an instructors name and department but not salary,

```sql
select ID,name,dept_name
from instructor
```

View provides mechanism to hide certain data from the view of certain users

## What are Transactions?

Transaction consists of a sequence of query and/or update statements and is a unit of work

SQL standard specifies that a transaction begins implicitly when an SQL statement is executed

Transaction must end with one of the followings :

- Commit work : Updates performed by the transaction become permanent in the db
- Rollback work : All the updates performed by SQL statements in the transaction are undone

### What is atomic transaction?

Either fully executed or rolled back as if it never occured

## What are Integrity Constraints?

Integrity constraints guard against accidental damage to the db by ensuring that authorized changes to db do not result in a loss of data consistency

## Referential Integrity

Ensures that a value that appears in one relatino for a given set of attributes also appears for a certain set of attributes in another relation

Ex: If a biology is a department name appearing in one of the tuples in the instructor relation, then there exists a tuple in the department relation for biology

## What are Assertions?

- An assertion is a predicate expressing a condition that we wish the database always to satisfy

A role is a way to distinguish among various users as far as what these users can access-update in the db
