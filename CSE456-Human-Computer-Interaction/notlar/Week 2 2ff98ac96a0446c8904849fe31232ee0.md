# Week 2

There are color blind people among us

Color intensity is also different in each humans

for everybody black on white is easier to read

Yellow on a white is harder to read than blue on write

Two types of contrast: luminance and colour

### Luminance Contrast

Intensity, amount of light emitted by an object depends on the amount of light falling on the object and its reflective properties

### Colour Contrast

Right is more effective but you use them together, it is OK

### Why do we use color?

- To label certain items
- To indicate a variable value
- Discriminate different items
- Make a real life analogy
- For decoration and satisfaction

### Stroop Effect

Anything that you use should not conflict with the content of the interface and appearance of the interface

RGB is used in monitors (generating model)

for the papers we use CMYK model (based on absorbtion)

Cyan yellow magenta K → black

Anything you new paint absorbs

positive → warm

negative → cold

Some colors are significant, if you use them you should make it in a smaller place in order to have a visual balance

Complementary colors can be used in the interface

use distinct colors for labeling

### Abbe Value

Property of an optical lens material. A measure of the degree to which light is dispersed or sepereated when passing through a lens.

Due to abbe value, we don’t use different wavelengths on the interface for the text

Fast movement of eyes while reading : Saccades.

They are followed by fixations

Reading is affected by : 

- Visual angle
- Illumnination contrast
- Color constrast
- Line length
- Upper-lower case
- Familiar or unfamiliar words

Reading in foreign languages are different

Dense Group

![Untitled](Week%202%202ff98ac96a0446c8904849fe31232ee0/Untitled%2011.png)

Sparse Group

- Proximity : Things that are close together are perceived as a group
- Similarity : Human brain tends to perceive similar elements as grouped
- Continuity : Smooth and continious visual elements are more likely to be perceived as an entity than ones that contain abrupt changes in direction
- Also drawing the lines with smooth continious lines makes them easier to follow than lines with abrupt changes

- Symmetry : Human brain tries to group symmetrical figures
- Closure : Human brain tends to close contours that have gaps in them

- Relative size : Smaller components of a pattern are perceived as objects whereas the bigger components are seen as background

- Figure and Ground : A figure is a pattern that is perceived as an object that is being in the foreground. The ground is the space behind the figure. The human brain tends to pick out forms

Right one is better

Yellow looks bigger than blue

Equal spacing is not a good thing.

## Hearing

Try to use true sounds for warnings or approvals.

Depend on the environment, sound volume should be up or down

joystick : haptic

read with finger : tactile - feeling surface

Finger feels the click when you press in tactile

a : response time

b: how good the interface is

Put the frequently used items in the up

Don’t use narrow linese in the hierarchial intefaces
