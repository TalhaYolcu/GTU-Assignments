# Week 3

### Perceptual Process

Anything that is seen by our eyes has to be processed and its not free

Developer and users may be in different human groups

Images that we already are familiar with simply match to images stored in our memory

- processing time is fast
- processing effor is low

The time it takes to visually understrand a scene depends on

- The number of unique element that we must visually identify in the scene
- Familiarity with the elemets
- Relationship between elements
- Properties of the elemetnt - color etc

People have a hard time overcoming well practiced skills - like reading

We need to design apps that match acquired skills and work habits

User testing is a good way of determining if our designs violate over learned skills

### Mental model

The mental image that users develop is usually influenced by their real word experiences with other objects or apps

- When we learn we look for patterns which can be used to predict future outcomes
- Our mental models are often incomplete and sometimes superstitious

By undestanding mental models

- We can predict and explain user behaviors

The mental model of a device is formed largely by interpreting its perceived actions and its visible structure.

- Designers and engineers must create products that are parralel to users mental models
- Mental model and designer model should be consistent
- Otherwise users will follow their artificial mental model and mistakes occur as a result
- When user mental model results in expected outcomes mental is strengthed and user continues to use the system with more confidence
- If the mental model results in unexpected outcomes, users develop new mental models based on the results and behave accordingly
- If the second model does not provide desired results either user becomes confused and moved into uncertainity  without knowing what to do
- Sometimes claims that system is not working

### Affordance

How an object explains itself

### Mapping

Accordence with its use, its effect

which one is controlling which one

Assumptions can make easy things hard

User habits and acquired skills can sometimes prevent creative actions

We dont always know how user thinks

- If user follows on a different model than the presented model as he/she completes tasks, it will be very difficult to finish the task successfully
    - automated learning must be provided
    - selection among targets must be provided
    - outcomes of actions should be easily perceived
    - people like solvable problems, dislike other ones
    

### Attention

- May increase success rate
- Big changes are more noticeable
- Things that are closer to where user looks are easier to notice
- We can ignore visual signals but we cannot ignore auditory signals easily

### Metaphors

- A known entity from real life is visually represented with an image or an object
- Are used in ICON design
- All users must understand icons

Do not iconize text

1. Correct design method should be selected
2. Incremental abstaction should be performed
3. Coordination must be carefully done to provide visual compatibilty among metaphors

### Correct design method

- If the concept has a strong base, relates to a familiar object which is tangible understandable by looking then ICON should be used
- If the concept is used several times in an app, SYMBOL or INDEX might be better idea.
- If the concept describes more abstract process or state change, then LABEL should be preferred
- Mixing them unnecessarily can cause usability problems

### Incremental Abstraction

- Level of abstraction should be determined based on a topic, screen chocies and user chars
- Starting image should include all significant details and should be taken from the correct angle where these details are visible
- Following original lines simpler drawings are obtained incrementally
- Only important details are drawn at each step
- Complext shapes should be converted to simpler geometries

### Coordination

- Start drawing metaphors after all inital images are obtained
- Same perspective and viewing angle must be used for each metaphor, those that donâ€™t fit must be redrawn
- Same level of abstraction should be preferred - icon and symbol should not be mixed
- Always use consistent icons with respect to size, orientation, drawing style, color and visual weight
- Use same components in all metaphor library, same line widths, curves, patterns and other shapes
