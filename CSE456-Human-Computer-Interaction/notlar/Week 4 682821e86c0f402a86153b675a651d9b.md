## Anticipation

App should anticipate - understand what user needs, what they want to do

## User Control and freedom

Support undo and redo

## Autonomy

When you charge user, user learns fast. But it should not be hazardaous

Interface should respond user should not respond so long.

## Feedback

Interface should contain feedback,

positive messages will be good

## Consistency and standards

Follow platform conventions

Consistency with user expectations should be included

### Between app consistency

- look and feel of the inteface is similart to other apps familiar to user
- size color position as well as the functionality associated with common controls

### Within app consistency

The components in all the windows within the app must be same

- design team must produce interface standards
- functionality associated with common controls within app must be the same
