# Week 1

Purpose of technology is to enchance the quality of human life

Thanks to technology, we have better living spaces, eating and nutrition, enjoyment and education

Airplanes, locomotives etc interface design is complicated. If it works wine, then it is OK. After some time, it becomes hard to use, there is a need of redesign. People redesign it to make it less complicated. 

If we design the system correctly , driver error won’t happen.

There is semaphore system in railway systems

At the second world war, it is realized that it not the guns that performing not very well, they were pilots. Because equiment was very difficult to use.

## What is ergonomics?

It is the application of scientific information objects, systems and environment for human use

Traditionally thought of as how companies design tasks, work areas and machinery to maximize the efficeny and quality of their employee’s work

### What is Human Computer Interaction

User experience

HCI is the discipline concerned with the design,evaluation and implementation of interactive computing systems for human use

HCI and Ergonomics complements each other

Japanese - Asian interfaces are squeezed but European ones are distributed.

When you are designing interfaces, culture is also important.

The response that we give to the traffic signal is similart to the the response that we give on computer

Consumers make their chocies based on

- brand
- external look
- other user rumour
- performance - satisfaction
- ads

If the project is goint to look nice, you are happy as a developer

Good interfaces

- better project dev
- lower training cost
- enhanced and improved use
- better sales

Bad interfaces

- Long and repeated training requirement
- Users can get bored, frustrated
- Data loss and wrong inputs
- Stop using the applicance and/or a feature

At least %50 of the development time of a product, going to use interface development.

### Goal of Usability Studies

- Effectivenes : Does the app contain the functionality required by the user ?
- Efficiency : The resources -physical and mental- you use should be minimal like clicks,
- User Satisfaction : People should be happy the using the interface, customizable interface or → you entered wrong number vs please enter another number.

## Our Goal

Our product should be used effectively, efficiently and with satisfaction by the user.

In order to reach this goal as we design our product, we should:

- Understand human both psychologically and physically
- Understand tasks
- Understand environment
- Understand social environment
- Understand technical cap and limitations

### Human Capacity

We have to understand and study is human perceptual and motor cap.

Our product become successful products only if they are used by the consumers

User vision, hearing and physical limits and abilities must be taken into consideration
