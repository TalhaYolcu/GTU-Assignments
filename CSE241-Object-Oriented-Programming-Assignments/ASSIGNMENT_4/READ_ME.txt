I DECIDED THE DIRECTIONS LIKE THAT:

     . 6 1 .  
      5 x 2 .  
       4 3 . 

AND I DECIDED THE PLAY GAMES SEQUANTIALLY

IN MAIN FUNCTION THERE ARE DEFINITONS OF OBJECTS AND SOME CONSTRUCTORS ARE CALLED LIKE TWO PARAMETER-ONE PARAMETER - NO PARAMETER AND I SHOWED YOU ASSIGNMENT OPERATOR AND COPY CONSTRUCTOR IS CALLED SEPERATELY

I ALSO SHOWED THAT CONVERSION CONSTRUCTOR IS CALLED EXPLICITLY

AFTER THESE I CALLED playGame() FUNCTION THAT TAKES SIZE AND USER MODE IF THE USER IS NOT SPECIFY AT THE CONSTRUCTOR

AFTER INPUT CHECKING I STARTED MY readytoplay() FUNCTION THAT HAVE LOOP FOR GAMEPLAY

I AM TAKING INPUT FOR MOVE-SAVE-LOAD-UNDO FEATURES

DEPEND ON THE INPUT I AM IMPLEMENTING THE COMMAND

I DESIGN THE UNDO FEATURE LIKE THAT:
IF MODE IS USER VS COMPUTER, I AM USING THE PREFIX DECREMENT OPERATOR
IF MODE IS USER VS USER , I AM USING THE POSTFIX DECREMENT OPERATOR

I ADDED NEW FEATURE TO THE GAME FILES
IT'S THE ORDER OF MOVES SO THAT I CAN DO UNDO PROPERLY WHEN I LOAD A FILE

MY WIN CHECK FUNCTIONS STAYS THE SAME

MY SCORE FUNCTION LOOKS FOR IF THERE IS ANY MOVE AT IT'S LEFT OR DOWN IF SO,  THEN SCORE IS INCREMENTED BY ONE
