1-explain recursion overhead by comparing the following code fragments. Write down all memory accesses for eac fragment step by step

Code A
int factorial (int val) {
	if(val==1) {
		return 1;
	}
	return val * factorial(val-1);
}

Code B
int factorial(int val) {
	int res=1;
	for(int i = val;i>1;--i) {
		res = res*i;
	}
	return res;
}


2-scheduler accepts following tasks
	Release Time	Execution Time	Period
T1	0				5				18
T2	1				5				17
T3	2				5				16
T4	7				3				10

Draw scheduling diagram for
i)Round robin with the quanta = 2
ii)rate monotonic preemptive scheduler algoirthms

Discuss the difference between results (Draw diagram for time <=20)

3-Design a function in C++ that accepts a vector of integers and calculates its average using multiple threads running in a parallel.
int average(const std::vector<int32_t> &date,const uint8_t numThread);
Your function should use multiple threads to make the calculation faster by dividing input into multiple threads. Wait for all to terminate calculate all average. You can use class. Use c++11 threads.

4-Consider the following solution to the problem of critical section where two threads try to acces a shared resource.

Thread A
flag1 = 1
if(flag2!=0) {
	//resolve contention
}
else {
	//enter critic section
}
flag1=0;

Thread B
flag2=1;
if(flag1!=0) {
	//resolve contention
}
else {
	//enter critic section
}
flag2=0;

Are the code blocks critical section guaranteed to be mutually exclusive? If so explain how this solution works. If not explain how to guarantee it?
