# Week 1

RT Sistemlerde hızı 2 şekilde inceliyoruz.

Timeliness → işi zamanında yapma

Throughput → yeterince çok iş yapma

### What is System?

Mapping of inputs into outputs

### What is Response time?

Time interval between presentation of inputs and realization of outputs

### What is Failed System

System cannpt satisfy requirements

### What is Real Time System

1. Must satisfy bounded response time constraints or risk severe consequences, including failure
2. Logical correctness is based on both the correctness of the outputs and their timeliness

### What is Deadline?

Given time after a triggered event, by which a response has to be completed.

S→ Sensors → Input

A→ Actuator , Motor, Lazer ışını vs → Output

mü → mikroişlemciler

tau → yazılımlar, threadler , tasklar

Real Time Systemms are classifed into three

- Hard RTS
- Firm RTS
- Soft RTS

They are classifed into depend on the result of this question : 

What happens if we miss one or more few deadlines?

- Hard : none allowed before failure, deadline aşarsan sistemden fayda sağlayamıyosun.
- Firm : A few allowed before failure, 1-2 deadline kaçırırsa fail olmuyor ancak fazla olursa durur.
- Soft : No failure, degraded performance gecikme olsa bile fayda sağlayabiliyosun. Deadline aşabilir ama çok fazla da aşmasın. Sistem hala çalışmaya devam etsin.

### Total Failure : Hard Real Time

Failure to meet even a single deadline may lead to complete catastrophic system failure

### Not total failure, but still failure : Firm RT

Delayed result has no value, however the system is still functioning. Missing more than a few may lead to total failure

### Degraded Performance : Soft RT

Performance is degraded but not destroyed by failure to meet response - time constraints

### What is Deterministic System?

For each possible state and each set of inputs, outputs and next state can be determined

### What is Event Determinism?

Next states and outputs are known for each set of inputs that trigger events

### What is Temporal Determinism

Response time of outputs known

### Main Properties of RTS

- Timeliness : Producing outputs at the right time
- Predictability : Able to predict future consequences of current actions
- Testability : Requirements should be verified
- Cost Optimality : Energy consumption, memory, CPU
- Maintability : easy to modify, extend , fix
- Robustness : Handle peak loads, exceptions
- Fault Tolerance : System should not crash, downgrade instead

Synchonous event : jump instruction

Periodic : for loop

Aperiodic : if

Sporadic (very infrequent): divide by zero 

Asynchronous event : hardware interrupt

Periodic : clock interrupt

Aperiodic : regular, but not fixed period

Sporadic : power loss alarm

Period is actually deadline, so we don’t need a worst case exec. time

Real time systems = fast systems

There is no just one solution of a real time problems. Each problem has its seperate solution

There is no more a need to build a RTOS, bc many exists
