Why Automatic Code Generation?

Prevent mistakes, produce reusable easy code can be used by anyone

Another field for automaic code generation

C++ templates

If you give template parameter, then it is compile time programming

### Compiler Optimizations of Code

- Minimize maximize some attributes of an executable program during compilation
- some attributes  :
    - execution time
    - memory demand
    - power consumption

### Optimization Example : Use of Arithmetic Identities

Find useless arithmetic operations and eliminate

multiplication by 1, addition with 0

### Optimization Example : Reduction in Strength

Find the fastest machine language instructions for a given operation

multiplications with powers of two : bitwise operations

### Optimization Example : Common Subexpression Elimination

Prefetch : When a cache prefetching mechanism is employed, the cache controller monitors the patterns of memory accesses made by the CPU or the program running on it. Based on these patterns, the cache controller predicts which data might be needed in the future and fetches it into the cache before it is actually requested. By doing so, the data can be accessed faster if and when it is needed, leading to a potential improvement in overall system performance.

By prefetching data into the cache, the hope is to reduce cache misses and minimize the time spent waiting for data to be fetched from slower levels of memory. However, prefetching is not always beneficial and can sometimes lead to wasted memory bandwidth and cache pollution if the predictions are incorrect. Therefore, prefetching algorithms need to strike a balance between accurately predicting future accesses and avoiding unnecessary prefetches.

# Making Linux Real Time

Is Linux Real Time ?

Linux is optimized for throughput, not determinism

Problem is unbounded latencies. Latencies in

- interrupt
    - hardware
    - handler
- scheduler

### What is latency?

Time taken from external interrupt till a userspace process to react to the interrupt

### Solution :

### Dual Kernel

Customizeed RT kernel with bounded latencies

Regular linux kernel as a low priority RT task

![Untitled](Week%208%200c6a2b21d1404f118236d74635e05064/Untitled%2015.png)

HAL : Hardware Abstraction Layer

### In kernel / single kernel

Modify linux kernel, remove unbounded latencies

### PREEMPT_RT

Linux un RT hali

### Fine Grained locking

Instead of a one large lock in a one function, using two different lock in a function.

### Preemptable kernel - Kernel Preemption

When a task makes system call, it gets into kernel mode

Then this task become unpreemtable. A task can be preempted when in user mode

PREEMPT_RT makes the system calls preemptable.

? → latency

### Schedulable ISR’s - Threaded Interrupts

In normal linux, ISR’s disable interrupts

ISR does minimal work.

In PREEMPT_RT , all interrupt handlers are switched to threaded interrupts

Priorities can be configured

### Replacing spinlocks with mutexes

Spinlock is a kind of mutex

```cpp
while(m_lock.load()==false);
```

uses CPU, another thread cant use the CPU because of this

if we use

```cpp
 std::lock_guard<std::mutex>lock(m)
```

other threads can use the CPU, we are blocked.

### PREEMPT_RT is not enough

- Commonly used memory should be paged in
- Take cache into consideration
- Consider pipelines
- Priorities should be assigned and managed properly
